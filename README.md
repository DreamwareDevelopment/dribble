# GoalTime

## Local Development

1. Install Docker Desktop
2. Get a copy of .env for the Next App and .env.local for Supabase and Prisma (they should always be in sync)
3. Setup ngrok with the following config
```ngrok.yml
version: "3"
agent:
    authtoken: <your-token>
tunnels:
  first:
    addr: 3000
    proto: http
    domain: <your-next-static-domain>
  second:
    addr: https://localhost:54321
    proto: http
    domain: <your-supabase-static-domain>
```
- Set the site_url to your next ngrok url in config.toml
- Set the additional_redirect_urls to ["https://<your-next-ngrok-url>/auth/callback"] in config.toml
- Request that your next ngrok url be added to HCaptcha and Google OAuth
- Set FUNCTIONS_URL secret in Supabase Vault to your supabase ngrok url
- Setup NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST to your next ngrok url in both .env and .env.local
4. Run `ngrok start --all` or `npx nx@latest shared:local-proxy`
5. Run `npx nx@latest shared:db` to start the local supabase containers
6. Run `CREATE ROLE "service" WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '<password>';` in the supabase dashboard
- Set the credentials for service in the SUPABASE_PRISMA_URL in both the .env .env.local files
- You'll need to run `npx nx@latest shared:db` again for the changes to take effect
7. Run `npx nx@latest shared:init` to initialize the database and apply schema migrations
8. Run `npx nx@latest shared:functions` to start the supabase edge functions runtime
9. Navigate to your next ngrok url in your browser to start using the app

## On Prisma Migrations

If any migration fails to apply you can go to the project.json for the shared project go to `npx nx@latest shared:rollback-failed-migration` and edit the command with the name of the failed migration. Afterwords running `npx nx@latest shared:migrate` should work if the migration is successful.

✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is almost ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/nx-api/next?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Finish your CI setup

[Click here to finish setting up your workspace!](https://cloud.nx.app/connect/0uEvf7QzRj)


## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
npx nx dev goaltime
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build goaltime
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project goaltime
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/next:app demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/react:lib mylib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.
